            <a href="javascript:toggleElement('a3')">What will happen if my car is financed by a bank and I want to sell it to CARBEE?</a>
        </p>
        <div id="a3" style="display:none">
            If the car you want to sell is financed, simply bring along a current dated foreclosure letter issued by the bank and we will pay the loan on your car. The settlement amount will be deducted from the CARBEE quote for your car. Alternatively, you can settle
            the loan yourself before selling the car to us. CARBEE may hold back a certain amount until the bank loan clearance NOC is submitted by you.

        </p>
        <div id="a4" style="display:none">
            The website quote is an estimated value range generated by our pricing algorithm based on some broad parameters like car make and model, variant, odometer reading and other details that you enter on the website. The final price quote offered also takes
            into consideration the physical condition of your vehicle as evaluated during the inspection process and market conditions.

            This may just happen because we are not currently present in your state. However, we are expanding at a rapid pace and plan to launch the used car buying service in many more cities pan India, very soon.

        </p>
        <div id="a8" style="display:none">
            Yes. By booking an appointment with us, you are reserving your dedicated slot to be catered to by one of our associates at the branch. In case, you drop in at any of our branches without having an appointment booked, you will be asked to book one on the
            spot. This will lead to unnecessary wastage of time and efforts which we tend to avoid. We are serving several customers at a time and our goal is to ensure all of them receive the same kind of experience. Having dedicated slots booked in
            advance helps us achieve the same and allows us to serve our customers in the best way possible.

        <a href="javascript:toggleElement('a11')">Why is there a difference between the online valuation and the actual price offered at the branch?</a>
        </p>
        <div id="a11" style="display:none">
            The online valuation indicates the estimated range you can get for your car considering it is in a picture-perfect condition. The detailed inspection conducted at the branch which determines the physical health and working of the car’s components decides
            what the final quote offered will be. The factors that impact the value of your car include the car make, aesthetics and mechanical condition, odometer reading and market conditions.

        <a href="javascript:toggleElement('a12')">What all do you check during the inspection of my car?</a>
        </p>
        <div id="a12" style="display:none">
            Our used car inspection process is fair and thorough to ensure an objective standardized report that gives a clear view of the condition of your car. We start with a document check and test drive and then use the latest tools to assess the exterior, tires,
            engine, transmission, interiors and electricals. We also inspect the steering mechanism, suspension, brakes and accessories of your car during the test drive. Feel free to ask any questions from our team at the branch.

            car conditions, when the car inspection process may even extend to 90 minutes.
